# EchoMatch

A modern memory matching game built with React, combining visual waveform patterns with dynamic audio feedback. Challenge your memory by matching tiles based on both sight and sound.

## Features

-   **Dynamic Audio Generation:** Every tile has a unique sound generated in real-time using the Web Audio API. No audio files are used.
-   **Six Unique Waveforms:** Match tiles based on six distinct waveform patterns: Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth, Pulse, and Echo.
-   **Progressive Difficulty:** The game gets more challenging as you advance, with more tile pairs in each level.
-   **Scoring and Combos:** Build up a combo multiplier for consecutive matches to achieve a high score.
-   **Stunning Visuals:** Features a futuristic, glowing aesthetic with smooth animations and optional particle effects.
-   **Responsive Design:** Playable on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Play

1.  **Start the Game:**
    -   From the home screen, click the **Start Game** button.
2.  **Flip Tiles:**
    -   Click on a tile to flip it over, revealing its waveform and playing its unique sound.
3.  **Find Matches:**
    -   Listen to the sounds and look at the patterns to find a matching pair.
4.  **Level Up:**
    -   Clear all the pairs on the board to complete the level and advance to the next.

## AI-Generated Code Disclaimer

This project was developed with assistance from AI, particularly for generating the mathematical logic behind the dynamic audio synthesis and waveform animations.
